1. In AJ there can be many different type of forms. But lets learn a simple form and understand the basic flow.

2. First before start using the form, we must import the "FormsModule" in our module.ts file.
  - ...
  import { FormsModule } from '@angular/forms';

  - ...
  imports: [
    BrowserModule,
    FormsModule
  ],

3. Remember the "FormsModule" must be imported before we can use the form.

4. Next we build the simple html format of our form:
  - ...
  <form #myForm="ngForm" (ngSubmit)="getData(myForm.value)">
    <input type="text" name="user" placeholder="Enter Your Name..." ngModel>
    <br><br>
    <input type="text" name="email" placeholder="Enter Your Email-id..." ngModel>
    <br><br>
    <button>Register</button>
  </form>

5. As you can see, we have to pass an id. #myForm="ngForm" -- this identify our form.

6. Next part (ngSubmit)="getData(myForm.value) is event which takes an id and let determine which form attribute we want to target. Like we wanted the "value".

7. All input element must have 'ngModel' and 'name' attribute to be able to fetch data.

8. Next we go to our logic part:
  -...
  import {NgForm} from '@angular/forms';

  -...
  getData(data: NgForm) {
    console.log(data);
  }

9. Next we import NgForm to let our function know which type form data we are getting. You can do it with "any" as well.
