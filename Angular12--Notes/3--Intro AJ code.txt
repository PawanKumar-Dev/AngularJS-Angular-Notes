1. app.component.html is the main file that rendering our default page. You can edit with simple html.

2. Interpolation: It the way we access/show dynamic data on the html part. It happens with syntax {{}}.

3. This "dynamic data" is get from "__.component.ts" file. Where we write our logic in TS(typescript). Its called dynamic becoz it can be generated in .ts file, or come from another component or an API.

4. This data can be variable, functions etc(all passed in typescript format). 
  ...
    export class AppComponent {
    title = 'myblog';
    hey = 'Pawan';
    greet() {
      return "Hey Pawan this is a function";
    }
  }

  ...
    <h2>{{hey}}</h2>
    <h3>{{greet()}}</h3>

5. What we can do with Interpolation:
  - we can match/compare values.
  - can do calculation with maths expression
  - run functions
  - run loops
  - almost all things we can do with Vanilla JS

6. What we can't do with Interpolation:
  - {{hey = raju}} cannot happen. Result error. Meaning we cannot assign value to variables in Interpolation
  - cannot check typeof variable like in normal JS
  - cannot use increment(++) or decrement(--) operator
