1. Pipes are piece of code which allow us to transform data in the view part of Angular JS. It helps us format the shown data correctly.

2. For example we can transform lowercase data to uppercase with simple "pipe".
  - ...
    <h1>{{title|uppercase}}</h1> or <h1>{{title|lowercase}}</h1>

3. Pipes always work on the view part of AJ. Never in the logic part.

4. Why Pipes because they are simple and doesn't need a lot of coding. You can achieve the same thing with coding yourselves but it is waste of time and code.
  - ...
  today = Date();

  - ...
  {{today}}
  // Result: Sat Aug 27 2022 22:03:44 GMT+0530 (India Standard Time)

5. Result might be correct but a bit too verbose and complicated. To format this data we can simple use a pipe, without tinkering with code.
  - ...
  <h2>{{today|date:'fullDate'}}</h2>
  // Result: Saturday, August 27, 2022

  - ...
  <h2>{{today|date:'longDate'}}</h2>
  // Result: August 27, 2022
