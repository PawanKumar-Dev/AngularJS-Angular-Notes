1. Functions works pretty much same as JS except we need to remember that Typescript use the OOP approach and most of your functions will be inside a "class".

2. Easiest way to do this is to write your function in ".ts" file and access it in html view.
  ...
  getName() {
    alert("Pawan");    
  }

  ...
  <button (click)="getName()">Click Me</button>

3. Our event handler "click" is written inside parenthsis called "Banana Bracket".

4. When passing parameter in functions, we need to remember that Typescript from AJ12 onward has configration set for "strict mode" activated in tsconfig.ts file.

5. So we need to define what "data type" of argument we are recieveing.
  ...
  getName(name:string) {
    alert("Pawan");    
  }

  ...
  <button (click)="getName('Raju')">Click Me</button>

6. You can also use the "any" type to temprory bypass strict mode of Typescript.
