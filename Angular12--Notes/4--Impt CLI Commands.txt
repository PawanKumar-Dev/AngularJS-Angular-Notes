1. Angular CLI commands make our work easier and faster. Here some important CLI commands that need to be remembered: 

2. Creating component(use without quote):
  -- ng generate component 'component-name-here'

  short version:
  -- ng g c 'component-name-here' 

3. All these components are generated directly inside the src/app folder.

4. Creating Modules(They are folder/collections which comprise of many smaller components together).
  -- ng g m 'module-name'

5. To make a component inside the module we do this cmd:
  -- ng g c 'module-name'/'component-name'


6. To make a class:
  -- ng generate class 'class-name'

7. To make a interface:
  -- ng generate interface 'interface-name'

8. To build final files:
  -- ng build

9. This build cmd generate a dist folder, which is then deployed for live app
