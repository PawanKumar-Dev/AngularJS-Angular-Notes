1. Template Reference Variable is nothing but the variable or id we use in our input elements to track its different properties.

2. For example
  - ...
  getValue(data:any) {
    console.log(data);    
  }

  - ...
  <input type="text" name="user" placeholder="some text" #box>
  <button (click)="getValue(box.name)">Submit</button>

3. The "#box" we passed into the input html element is our template reference variable.
With "#box" we can track anything. Input element entered value, its placeholder value or even its "name" attribute value.
