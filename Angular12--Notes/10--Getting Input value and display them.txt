1. One way to take input and show it to your html view is through standard way:
  - ...
    <input type="text" #textbox (keyup)="showText(textbox.value)" placeholder="Enter Text">
    <h4>{{displayText}}</h4>

  - ...
    displayText :string = '';

    showText(text :string) {
      this.displayText = text;
    }

2. In this way we pass our data via function and hold it in a variable which is printed on view.

3. Similarly you can hold these value in variable and show it only on "btn click". That can be done by simply changing our event.
  - ...
    <input type="text" #textbox placeholder="Enter Text">
    <button (click)="showText(textbox.value)">Display Data</button>
    <h4>{{displayText}}</h4>

  - Logic part remain same as above.

4. Finally there is "ng-model" way which allow the "two-way binding". Refer future notes.

5. By changing "value" to any other attribute of html element. You can get their info too. Like placeholders, name, class etc.
  - ...
    <input type="text" #textbox placeholder="Enter Text">
    <button (click)="showText(textbox.placeholder)">Display Data</button>
