1. Two way binding is simple process where we enter data and show that data at same time. It's is easiest to accomplish in AJ by using "ng-model" directive.

2. There are other ways to do two-binding. But this is shortest and easiest.

3. First we must create a variable which is storing our data to be displayed. For our ease we are making it "any".
  - ...
  username: any;
  
4. Then we create an input which is receiving data and then showed that data back.
  - ...
  <input type="text" [(ngModel)]="username">

  <h3>{{username}}</h3>

5. [(ngModel)] we call these brackets "banana in the box". But we will get error right now since we didn't imported the "FormsModule";

6. For importing module, in this we go to our "app.module.ts" file. After importing, we register the module too.
  - ...
  import { FormsModule } from '@angular/forms';

  ...
  @NgModule({
    declarations: [
      AppComponent
    ],
    imports: [
      BrowserModule, FormsModule  //Here we register our module
    ],
    providers: [],
    bootstrap: [AppComponent]
  })
  export class AppModule { }
