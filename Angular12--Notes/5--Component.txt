1. Component is fundamental building block of AJ. It contains:
  - HTML file: which contains the HTML view part
  - CSS file containing CSS style of that component
  - Typescript file which holds all the logic 
  - Testing spec typescript file for testing purposes.

2. You can generate Components with CLI command:
  -- ng generate component 'component-name'

3. Whenever a new component is generated, its code is automaticlly imported in "app.module.ts" file. And registered as component. Without this you can't access/use your component.

4. When you want to publish your component to your app. You need to know about your "selector" and put it in the main "app.component.html". We just use it as a html tag.
  <component-selector></component-selector>

5. You can change your component name and thus your selector name by editing that component ".ts" file.
