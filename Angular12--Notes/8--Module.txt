1. Modules are fully functional units containing different components. They are next stage in AJ folder structure after component. They make AJ code more modular.

2. A typical Module contains components, services and pipes. A Module can many or very few of them their is no limit.

3. Generate module:
  - ng generate module 'module-name'

4. While components are reusable in nature. Modules can be harder to reuse.

5. To make components inside your module, we do:
  - ng generate component 'module-name'/'component-name'

6. Now when you want to use this component in view of app. We can't do the usual:
  <component-name></component-name>   ---> gives us error

7. To make it work, first we register this component in our module ts file. And export it
  ...
    imports: [
      CommonModule
    ],
    exports: [
      SignInComponent       ---> We need to export our component
    ]
  })
  export class UserAuthModule { }

8. After this go to you main module file -- "app.module.ts" and register your module where your component resides.

  - import { UserAuthModule } from './user-auth/user-auth.module';

  - ...
      imports: [
        BrowserModule,
        UserAuthModule    --> Here we are importing our custom module
      ],
