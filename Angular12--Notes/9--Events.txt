1. We can use all events of JS in AJ. But syntax is different. We use the "banana bracket style".
  - <button (click)="getName()">Click Me</button>

2. Remember all logic is defined inside our ".ts" file for these events.

3. Similarly you can use these events in input tags too. Like 'blur', 'keydown' etc. All events names are smallcap in AJ.
  - <input type="text" (keydown)="printText()" placeholder="Enter Text here...">

  - ...
    printText() {
      console.log("You are typing...");
    }

4. You can even pass data from input field to the function, using an "id"
  - <input type="text" #entrTxt (keydown)="printText(entrTxt.value)" placeholder="Enter Text here...">

  - ...
    printText(entrTxt: string) {
      console.log(entrTxt);
    }

5. Similarly you can use any JS event.
