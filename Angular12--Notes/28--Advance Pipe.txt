1. Params in Pipes or parameters in pipes is another concept of AJ. Where we can modify pipes functionality by supplying different parameters.

Note: Not all pipes need Params. But a lot of them do.

2. Lets see our SlicePipe which works with one or two params.
  - https://angular.io/api/common/SlicePipe

  - ...
  <h1>{{title|slice:4}}</h1>

  //Result before slice: my-first-project
  //Result after slice: irst-project

3. As you saw our slice pipe took first param as the number from where our string is sliced. but we can provide 2nd param and determine the end point of string.
  - ...
  <h1>{{title|slice:4:9}}</h1>

  //Result before slice: my-first-project
  //Result after slice: irst-

4. So basically it counted from 4 to 9 and saved only those characters from string. And others were sliced off.

5. Similarly you can and use another pipe in conjunction with first one.
  - ...
  <h1>{{title|slice:4:9|uppercase}}</h1>

  - ...
  //Result: IRST-

6. Another pipe which we use a lot to peek at our JSON data is json-pipe.
  - ...
  incomingdata = {
    name: "Pawan",
    phone: 8880011100,
    email: "pk@gmail.com"
  }

  - ...
  <h2>{{incomingdata}}</h2>

7. When you try to access normal json data you run into problem that it will show up in view as "[Object object]". Sure we can process with a loop. But to take a peek at data, that a lot of work. That's where our "json" pipe comes in.
  - ...
  <h2>{{incomingdata|json}}</h2>

8. Wallah! you have the data printed. And you have your peek at json data.

9. We can also attach currency symbols in front of text where we want with currency pipe.
  - ...
  <h2>{{1000|currency:"USD"}}</h2>

  - ...
  $1,000.00
