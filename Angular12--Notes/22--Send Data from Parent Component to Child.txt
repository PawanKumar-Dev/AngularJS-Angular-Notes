1. When developing Web Apps, we need to transfer data from parent component to child components. It is essential for managing apps in AJ.

2. Child component is a name for a component which will inherit data from another component. So there is no special process to make such component.

3. Lets consider two main components in our simple app.
  -- main app component --> app.component.html, app.component.ts
  -- child component --> child.component.html, child.component.ts

4. First we create data in parent .ts file and pass it into child selector calling.
  - ...
  export class AppComponent {
  datainparent = 15;
  username = "Pawan";

  - ...
  <app-child [item]="datainparent" [user]="username"></app-child>

5. Next we need to pass these "data" and bind them in child component .ts file.
  - ...
  import { Component, OnInit, Input } from '@angular/core';
  ...
  ...
  export class ChildComponent implements OnInit {
    @ Input() item = 0;
    @ Input() user = "Username is here...";
  }

6. After binding, we can use or access them in Child Component's html file.
  - ...
  <p>{{item}}</p>
  <h3>{{user}}</h3>
